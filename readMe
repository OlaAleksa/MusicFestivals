The site is based on the React component library for creating SVG maps using d3-geo and topojson and Realtime Database - Firebase. Based on data entered into my API, markers with marked festivals automatically appear on the map, and after clicking on a selected festival - a window with information about the given event. I will continue to develop the project and add new functionalities to it. In the near future I will be working on adding the possibility of searching for the festival after the date, place or artist name.
